# sortviz
A simple flask webapp to visualize various sorting algorithms.

## Test it
To host the project locally, run host.py with the python 3.x interpreter. It should look something like:
```
python3 host.py
```
The project will probably be live [here](http://vamsi101.pythonanywhere.com/)

## Built with
* [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) - Used to show simple HTML5 bar charts
* [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - The (python3) web framework used (although minimally, simply to host it on [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/))
